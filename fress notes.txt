To run this, You need to have built it. On Windows, pretty easy. On Mac
you need to have installed some native libraries.

This was a pain, but currently I have it running with 2.4.2_1 of
libsfml. I don't think I had to build them by hand, so perhaps this will
work:

brew install sfml --version 2.4.2_1 
dotnet build
./run.sh hostname port
e.g. 
./run.sh 52.203.10.15 3270

You can just close the app, it disconnects, but
won't logout unless you want to. It's easier if you don't. If fress
is already running just issue a set window command to refresh the
terminal:
sw 3a

Things you can do In CMS
ls b // List all files
ls b (o fress // list all fress files
